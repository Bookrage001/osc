# Editing sessions

The session editor can be enabled from the sidepanel. Once enabled, clicking on a widget will make it the *selected widget*.

## Root panel

The root panel can be selected by clicking on the "Root" button in the sidepanel.

## Context menu

Right clicking / long touch on a widget or on a tab will also display a context menu providing useful utilities :

- `Edit parent`: select widget's parent for edition
- `Copy`: copy widget's data
- `Cut`: copy widget's data and delete selected widget
- `Paste`: paste copied widget in selected container
  - `n+1` : increments the id of the copied widget (and all its children) before pasting
  - `Clone` : paste the exact same widget
- `Add widget`: create a new widget in selected container
- `Add tab`: create a new tab in selected container
- `Delete`: delete selected tab or widget

## Save

Current session can be exported as a `.json` file. When overwriting a session file that's currently is use by other clients, they will reload it automatically.

## Load

Loading a session file doesn't affect other clients.

## Grid

By default, widget resizing / dragging snaps to a 10 pixel wide grid. Its width can be customized in the editor (when it's enabled). Setting its width to 1 will disable it. Note that the grid doesn't affect manual setting of a widget's size / position.

## Properties

Selected widget's properties are displayed and can be modified in the sidepanel. The [widgets reference](widgets/widgets) section lists the available properties for each widget type. Property fields are all multiline (press `shit + enter` for new line).

Properties are written in JSON, with some flexibility brought by the [JSON5](https://github.com/json5/json5) format. For example, doubles quotes around object keys are not mandatory. All input will be converted to standard JSON.


## Widget resizing / dragging

Selected widget can be resized using its south, south-east and east handles. It can be dragged with its north-west handle.
